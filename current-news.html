<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><strong>Notes From the Chairman</strong></h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span></span>Following the 2019 AGM and my usual plea for
	more
	volunteers, I am delighted to say that two people have stepped forward and offered to become Trustees. This is
	wonderful news and I would like to offer my congratulations to Margaret Winders and Mike Teasdale and welcome them
	on board. &nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that they will find the involvement as Trustees and members of the Executive
	Committee interesting and rewarding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of you will know Margaret who is responsible for running (and
	stocking) the FoN Shop in the Nonsuch Gallery, and Mike Teasdale who, (after 8 years on Epsom &amp; Ewell&lsquo;s
	Borough Council,) has just stepped down from the Chair of the Nonsuch Joint Management Committee (&mdash; so we
	could not ask for someone more committed to Nonsuch! ).<br /><br />As I write this I have just returned home from
	Nonsuch where we have entertained&nbsp; (no tea or encouragement)&nbsp; the judges for the Heritage Park category of
	the South and South East in Bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;Half an hour was allocated to us, but the judges arrived 15 minutes
	early and said that we only had 15 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;So a rapid tour ensued with Wendy and Gerald rushing them
	through and trying to show them everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;Well done to both of you and we hope that this year we might
	be successful.<br /><br />We have also had news that the stucco panel is complete and arrangements are being made to
	hang it on the long wall, which is where most people felt it should go.&nbsp; &nbsp;Soon after you read this it
	should have been hung in the Nonsuch Gallery, thanks to Ian, and unveiled and become a major part of our
	exhibition.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are hoping that the Mayors of Epsom and Sutton will be able to attend the unveiling with
	attendant publicity.<br />&nbsp;<br />The long-case clock is still being lovingly restored, but will not be returned
	to us until August at the earliest. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is something else to look forward to.<br />Whether you have had
	your holidays or still have them to come, I hope that the weather is kind and you enjoy
	them.<br /><span></span><em><strong><br /><span>&#8203;Tony Kerslake</span></strong></em></div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;"><strong>The Museum</strong></h2>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">As soon as a decision is made the dates of opening will be displayed
	here.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Help needed! </strong>Unfortunately we have recently lost several stewards for a
	variety of reasons. As a result of this I am finding it increasingly difficult to cover all the stations in the
	Museum. In particular I only have a few stewards available on one particular date. This is <strong>Sunday 26th
		August </strong>(<u>and</u> the next day which is a Bank Holiday Monday). I would be very grateful if anyone
	could spend some time helping on these dates &ndash; or any of the openings in September for that matter. The
	opening times are usually 2-5pm and can be divided into two slots of 2-3.30pm and 3.30 &ndash; 5pm. Please ring me
	&nbsp;(tel. 020 8644 2455) if you can help.<br /><br /><em>Wendy Mayes</em></div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><strong>2019 Working Party Report</strong></h2>

<div class="paragraph"><span>
		<font color="#000000">How time flies!<span> </span>We will soon be coming to the end of another successful
			<span>season for the Museum and Gallery and it will be time to put the Museum </span>displays to
			bed<span>&nbsp; </span>--<span>&nbsp; </span>but only after special openings for Heritage and national Open
			Days in September!
		</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">We have been busy as usual with the ongoing maintenance of the Service Wing.<span>
			</span>Lots and lots of small but essential jobs that require attention - painting windows, fence post
			repairs, replacement of lighting in the display cabinets, wood preserver on the bell 'tabernacle',
			etc.<span> </span>New donation boxes have been made.</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">The big event of the year was the purchase of a 'summer house', at the entrance to the
			Service Wing, to greet our visitors.<span> </span>Many thanks to everybody that helped to put it up and
			paint it with preservative.<span> </span>It is a huge improvement and the stewards who man it appreciate the
			more sheltered seating area and protection from the vagaries of the English weather.</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">Many thanks again to the Working Party ladies, who do such an amazing job inside and
			outside to keep the Museum and the Courtyard looking smart and welcoming for our visitors.</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">Another thank you for all the help we receive to set up for the school visits and our
			monthly talks.<span> </span>The selection of cakes after the talks, with a cup of tea, is so
			enjoyable.<span> </span>On one school visit, an eight year old boy announced to me that it was Jeffrey
			Wyatt, who was the architect of the Mansion House.<span> </span>A future volunteer?</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">Again, please if you have any time to spare and would like to come along to the Stable
			Block on a Thursday morning for a coffee and chat about what we do there, we would love to see you.&nbsp;
