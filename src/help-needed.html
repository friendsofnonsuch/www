<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;">The Friends are involved in a number of projects all
	staffed by volunteers. There are many administrative functions such as&nbsp;<strong>STEWARDS, VISITS,
		&nbsp;PUBLICITY, </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>NEWSLETTER PRODUCTION, </strong>all of which&nbsp;&nbsp;must be
	staffed. It need not be onerous, if you can offer an hour or two a week your help would be invaluable.<br />

<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><strong>The Thursday Morning Work Party</strong> - <strong>
		<font size="4">and other mornings too, sometimes</font>
	</strong></h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Every Thursday morning sees our intrepid band of workers arriving at the
	Service Wing armed with tool boxes, tool bags, power tools, etc., ready to start the never-ending task of
	maintaining the Service Wing, inside and out, its gardens and its shrubbery. And we mustn&rsquo;t forget the work
	done in sorting out the many books donated by so many friends. This too is part of Thursday mornings&rsquo;
	work.<br /><br />During the open season, in the summer months, a great deal of time is devoted to keeping the garden
	area looking smart but, with autumn changing to winter, much pruning and cutting back of trees and shrubs has taken
	place. Our responsibilities also include the rose arbour and its numerous memorial plaques.<br /><br />Since the
	arrival of the magnificent model of Nonsuch Palace, all members of the Working Party have taken, and are still
	taking, a turn at stewarding on those days when it is open to the public.<br /><br />&#8203;If you would like to
	join us for friendship and camaraderie, please do contact me on 020 8393 0486. Thank you.<br /><br /><em>Ian
