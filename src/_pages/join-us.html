<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;"><strong>Annual Subscription: &pound;6 Individual / &pound;12
		Family<br />Please help us preserve the Nonsuch Park Estate for you</strong><br /><br />The Friends of Nonsuch
	have been in existence since the threat in 1991 that part of Nonsuch Park could become a golf course. Since then the
	Friends have worked tirelessly to protect both the Grade II* listed mansion house and the park.&nbsp;All the work
	was and still is done by volunteers. The organisation receives no grants or financial help from outside bodies and
	relies entirely on its own fund raising activities.</div>
