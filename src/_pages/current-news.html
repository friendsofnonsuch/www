	<h2><strong>Notes from the Chairman 2022</strong></h2>

	<p>We hope that things will really get back to normal this year.  The Service Wing Museum will be opening on 10th April 2022 and will be open on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month and Bank Holidays (12-4pm).  The Gallery is open every Sunday and Bank Holidays (12 - 4pm).  Not only do we have a fantastic model of Nonsuch Palace but we also have a full-size replica of one of the stucco panels that were on the side of the palace.  This gives a perspective of the size and grandeur of the Palace in its heyday.   The Service Wing Museum is a valuable showcase for what life was like for the servants of the Mansion House in the past.  We look forward to welcoming you back to the Museum and Gallery and also to the monthly talks that have been arranged, details of which can be found under events.</p>

	<h2><strong>Service Wing Museum and Gallery</strong></h2>

	<p>In order to make a visit to the Nonsuch Service Wing Museum an enjoyable and informative experience we try to have a steward in every room to explain how the room and the artefacts there were used by the servants of the day. These stewards are all volunteer members who give a little (or a lot in some cases!) of their time to keep the museum running. We also take parties of adults and groups of school children on tours of the service wing and the stewards are involved with those visits. We need people to help and are always grateful to welcome new people as stewards. This can involve as little as two hours at a time and can be as often or infrequent as liked. Information and help is given to all newcomers. If you feel you can give a little of your time and would like to join our happy band, please contact me.</p>

	<h2><strong>Working Party Report 2022</strong></h2>

	<p>Maintenance has been ongoing as usual.  Flat roofs and gutters have been cleared and cleaned.  The cement on the book store walls has been repaired with laminated panels which can be used for posters if required.  Fence posts in our garden will be repaired with wood supports after tree cutting is complete.</p>

	<p>Many thanks again to the working party ladies who do such an amazing job, inside and outside to keep the Museum and courtyard looking smart and welcoming for all our visitors.  Now the overhanging trees and bushes have been cleared, they are looking forward to re-landscaping the garden in the courtyard.  We are always looking for new help, so if you have any spare time come along to the Stable Block on a Thursday morning for a coffee and a chat about what we do, or phone me on <a href="tel:02083930486">020 8393 0486</a>.</p>

	<h2><strong>Bookstall</strong></h2>

	<p>With the opening of the service wing on Sunday 10th April 2022 we look forward to seeing you at the Nonsuch Book Room between noon and 4pm.  We have a great selection of books, both fiction and non-fiction, at very affordable prices.  We look forward to seeing you.</p>

	<p>I can be contacted on <a href="tel:01372725075">01372 725075</a> if you have unwanted good quality books which you wish to donate to the Friends.</p>

	<p>If you are interested in helping out at the Book Room when we are open, please contact me on the above number.  Any time you could offer would be very helpful and would not need to be on a regular basis. Thank you.</p>
