<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><STRONG>Nonsuch Palace Model</STRONG></h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Working tirelessly through the few illustrations and the extensive
	descriptions, coupled with knowledge gained from the excavation, it has been possible to create an image of the
	Palace that is unforgettable. The inner, or royal, courtyard was of a construction never attempted before, nor
	repeated since. It was a gigantic work of art. To see even this small representation of the building is to realize
	why Hoefnagel regarded it as one of the wonders of the world (the reason he painted his famous
	watercolour).<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>Actually creating this model has, of course, called on the
	outstanding expertise of our dedicated model-maker. The Friends&rsquo; selection of Ben Ruthven-Taggart has itself
	proved sensationally successful. His knowledge and ability to so adequately overcome the problems involved in
	miniaturisation has been tested to the utmost &mdash; and not found wanting!</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The Model is constructed in a variety of materials. The main structure
	is built in wood with architectural details added in various plastics, fibre-glass resin and brass. The most
	fascinating feature of the palace was its fantastically designed stucco plaster panels decorating the walls of the
	inner court and the exterior of the building. There are 695 stucco panels in all. For the purposes of building the
	model it was not practical to carve each panel individually. Instead a total of 149 panels were made depicting gods
	and goddesses, battling soldiers in classical attire, the busts of Caesars and many other compositions of
	figures.<br /><br />These master panels were carved and then cast in silicon rubber moulds and reproduced in plastic
	resin. The resin casts were arranged very carefully on the model so that no duplicate panels were near to one
	another. This gives the impression of each panel being unique.<br /></div>

							<div class="paragraph"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5;">Between the stucco
									panels, there were on the original building borders of slate roughly 6" wide, carved
									with a gilloche pattern and decorated with gold paint. These were represented on the
									model using thin brass sheets which had been acid etched with the design of the
									gilloche pattern. The brass was sprayed with black paint and then gently sanded with
									emery paper so that the brass is visible in the etched pattern. This replicates the
									detail of the gold paint exactly.</span><br /><br />The great day for the Friends of
								Nonsuch came on September 6th when Professor Martin Biddle unveiled the model of Nonsuch
								Palace. The model clearly shows, as no other medium can, that the &lsquo;royal&rsquo;
								part of the palace was in reality as much a gigantic work of art as it was a building.
								The result is a triumph for the model builder, Ben Taggart, and a fascinating
								interpretation of Professor Biddle&rsquo;s fifty-two years of research and a significant
								achievement of the Friends of Nonsuch. <br /><br /><strong>"We are now in the possession
									of a work of national importance and are taking on a duty to show it to as many
