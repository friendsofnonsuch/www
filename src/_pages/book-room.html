		The Nonsuch Book Room is open at all times when the Service Wing is open to the public. There is an extensive range of fiction and non fiction books at very reasonable prices so why not come along and have a browse. We have over a thousand books on our shelves. We can now take card payments so there is no reason not to buy a book!

		Donations of good quality books are always welcome and can be left with the working party on a Thursday morning between 9.30am and noon. Alternatively I can arrange collection. Please phone me on <a href="tel:+447847074624">07847 074624</a>.

		If you would like to help with the running of the Book Room please contact me on the mobile no above. No experience is needed so if you have a couple of hours to spare and enjoy the company of books why not get in touch?
