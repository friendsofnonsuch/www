<div class="paragraph">During the eighteenth century building design began to include an extra wing to house the servants and the new technology that was being developed.&nbsp; These were usually placed on the north side of the house and surrounded by hedges to hide them from view.&nbsp; They began as rectangular additions and were added to as need arose.&nbsp;The service wing at Nonsuch is placed on the north east side of the house and is accessed through an enclosed courtyard.&nbsp; The cellars can be entered by a ramp in one corner of this courtyard.&nbsp; The original service wing was connected to the dairy by a covered walkway and comprised the inner scullery, kitchen, inner and outer larders, the laundries and the stable block.&nbsp; Most of the service wing was constructed when the mansion house was erected but the remains of an earlier Georgian building were incorporated into the laundries.&nbsp; The brickwork in the outer scullery is different to that of the inner scullery which suggests that it was a later addition but the date is unknown.&nbsp; The pastry larder and game larder were added between the 1840s and 1860s. </div>

<div class="paragraph"><strong>THE DAIRY<br /></strong>The original dairy at Nonsuch had two entrances, one from the courtyard and the other from the gardens. Ladies of the house who visited the dairy, and may even have helped with the work, used the latter. At some later date, it was converted into a public toilet for the formal gardens.<br /><br />A smaller, adjacent building, the original purpose of which is unknown, was found to contain a collection of English delft tiles, much like those in larger country house dairies. It has been re-created by the Friends of Nonsuch, as an 18th century country dairy.</div>

While the brickwork was being repaired, it was discovered that there had been a fireplace in the corner nearest the kitchen.

<div class="paragraph"><STRONG>THE KITCHEN<br /></STRONG>The kitchen at Nonsuch is Georgian but was adapted in the Victorian period.The dresser and the open roasting range were part of the original kitchen although the Feetham closed range was added in the 1860s. (At some stage, the open roasting range was bricked up, but the Friends of Nonsuch uncovered and restored it.). The brick ovens under the window were part of a 'sauciere'. Sauces and slow cooking casseroles etc. were cooked on gentle heat. This simmering range was fuelled by charcoal and always situated next to windows to allow noxious fumes to escape.&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><strong>THE GAME or WET LARDER<br /><br /></strong>The Game Larder was designed to hold fresh meat, poultry and fish. It was also a place to keep prepared dishes cool until serving time. Perforated zinc was fitted over windows to allow air to circulate but keep insects out. Meat and poultry would have been hung from hooks. Fish would have been laid on the slate shelves. The Dutch crown in the centre of the larder was used for aging and storing game. It was raised and lowered by a pulley. The slate boxes under the shelves were used for storage.They each have lids that protected the food from vermin and kept it cool. &nbsp;One of these boxes was an icebox. Huge blocks of ice were covered and placed in the bottom and perishable food placed on top. Removing the bung at the bottom of the slate box would drain the melted ice away.<br /><br />Ice was stored in the icehouse situated on the far side of the kitchen garden <br /> behind the aviary. It has been taken down and grassed over.</div>

The laundries are one of the last areas of the Service Wing to have been used.

<div class="paragraph">A range of wooden tubs (now missing) under the windows would have been used for soaking and scrubbing the clothes before boiling them in the copper to remove the soap. Delicate items were washed carefully by hand.<br /><br />Fuel for the fire under the copper was kept,outside in the cloister behind the laundries and fed in through an outside stoke hole. (It is located outside the laundry in a covered walkway. But is inaccessible to the public.) A raised platform would have been placed around the copper to allow the laundry maids to reach inside.<br /><br />Removing the bung from the pipe at the side drained water from the copper. Not only did this empty the copper, it also served to wash the floors as it drained across to the grates at the window. Laundry maids either walked on duck-boards which covered the floor or wore "patens" to raise themselves off the wet floor.<br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><STRONG>THE DRY LAUNDRY</STRONG><br />This room was set aside for the drying and pressing of the laundry. There is a comprehensive display of irons used during the period of the house's occupancy but the only original piece to the house is the Box Mangle. <br /><br /></div>

<div class="paragraph">The Box Mangle was invented in the eighteenth century and allowed mangles to both press and wring. <br /><br /><STRONG>THE LOOSE BOX</STRONG><br />In its original form, the Loose Box was provided primarily for sick horses or mares in foal so they could lie down. At the Service Wing Museum it has been reincarnated as an exhibition space.<br /><br />Presumably, this part of the Stable Block was added to the existing stable in 1806- It is divided into two sections with a central drain. In the South East corner is a multiple feed, hay and water bay marked Paddington Iron Works 1806. <br /><br />During restoration, the original brick floor was lifted, cleaned, raised and reinstalled. The bricks were turned over for the re-installation.<br /><br /><STRONG>THE STAINED GLASS</STRONG><br />The permanent exhibition in the Loose Box is the Nonsuch Collection of Stained Glass. Please note that some of the stained glass is still in situ throughout the house and is not visible unless the main reception rooms are open.<br /><br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><STRONG>CHANGING EXHIBITIONS<br /></STRONG>An area of the Loose Box is reserved for changing exhibitions. The exhibition in the Loose Box in 2012 will be based on the work of the Friends of Nonsuch and the many events which have been organised over the past 20 years to make the necessary funds used for our voluntary work in the house and Park.<br /><br /><br /><STRONG>STABLE ROOM</STRONG><br />This room was originally a stable for four horses. During the renovations. it was discovered that the foundations were made with stone, probably recovered from the ruins of Nonsuch Palace. Pieces of the fabulous stucco decorations were found in the sand below the original brick floor. The room has been fitted out as a utility room,mainly to accommodate school parties visiting Nonsuch Park but it is also used for members talks and events. During public openings it serves to house our small shop.<br /><br /><STRONG>NONSUCH PALACE GALLERY</STRONG><br />The Nonsuch Gallery has been adapted from the former coach house. Once again,new floor, roof and windows have been provided. As with the Stable Room, the foundations appear to have been have been made with recycled stone, presumably from Nonsuch Palace. The Gallery is dedicated to the study and celebration of the great achievement of Nonsuch Palace.<br /><span></span><FONT color=#ffffff>.</FONT></div>
