<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><STRONG>The Friends</STRONG></h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">The Friends of Nonsuch was formed in 1991 to fight for the preservation Of
	the Nonsuch Park Estate as an open space accessible to all. Their successful campaign highlighted the need for
	conservation work on the Grade II* Listed Georgian Mansion House alongside other organisations such as the Nonsuch
	Watch who placed emphasis on preserving the parkland. Indeed the cost of renovations to the mansion house were a
	huge drain on council resources and one of the main reasons for the potential sale of the park and mansion house
	into private ownership. Since 1991 groups of volunteers have been restoring the Mansion and providing support to
	conservation projects within the mansion house.<br /><br />The Friends also have groups researching the rich history
	of the site and are very much concerned with the conservation of the parklands and gardens of Nonsuch Park. They
	work closely with Nonsuch Park Joint Management Committee who run the park on behalf of the London Borough of Sutton
	and Epsom &amp; Ewell as well as the other inhabitants of the Mansion House and the users of the park to help ensure
	that the park and mansion house are protected and conserved.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Friends opened the Service Wing Museum in 1993 which details the history of the site and also
	shows how a working service wing would have looked in the nineteenth century. In 2011 the group realised a long
	cherished ambition with the opening of the Nonsuch Palace Gallery which hosts the largest detailed model of Nonsuch
	Palace and an exhibition detailing the history of the palace.<br /><br />The Friends work closely with the Nonsuch
	Park Joint Management Committee who run the park on behalf of the London Borough of Sutton and Epsom &amp; Ewell
	Borough Council, as well as the other inhabitants of the Mansion House, and the users of the park to help ensure
	that the park and mansion house are protected and conserved.<br /><br /><strong>Memorial
