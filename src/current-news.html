<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><strong>Notes From the Chairman</strong></h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><span></span>In this frustrating period, where the impact of Covid on our everyday life has been enormous, we have been looking forward to the return to some form of normality. <br>
	We have taken the opportunity to update our website and you can see the results here. We hope that you like it and find it easier to use. If you have any suggestions for improving it further please let our secretary know. <br>
	We are also making plans for the re-opening of the museum and the Nonsuch Gallery and once these arrangements have been finalised the opening times will be displayed on this website. The Museum will always be of interest and on each visit I am sure that you will see items that you have not noticed before. <br>
	The Nonsuch Gallery now contains a full-size Stucco panel, a replica of one of the many that adorned the outside of the Palace. It really gives a proper perspective to the size and scale of the model. <br>
	We look forward to welcoming you back for another visit, or perhaps it will be your first visit. Either way do enjoy yourself â€“ I am sure that you will. <br>
	Once we are able to resume our series of talks we will, but with the current distancing constraints decimating our capacity, this might be a while yet. Again watch this website for further details.<br /><span></span><em><strong><br /><span>&#8203;Tony Kerslake</span></strong></em></div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title" style="text-align:left;"><strong>The Museum</strong></h2>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">As soon as a decision is made the dates of opening will be displayed
	here.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Help needed! </strong>Unfortunately we have recently lost several stewards for a
	variety of reasons. As a result of this I am finding it increasingly difficult to cover all the stations in the
	Museum. In particular I only have a few stewards available on one particular date. This is <strong>Sunday 26th
		August </strong>(<u>and</u> the next day which is a Bank Holiday Monday). I would be very grateful if anyone
	could spend some time helping on these dates &ndash; or any of the openings in September for that matter. The
	opening times are usually 2-5pm and can be divided into two slots of 2-3.30pm and 3.30 &ndash; 5pm. Please ring me
	&nbsp;(tel. 020 8644 2455) if you can help.<br /><br /><em>Wendy Mayes</em></div>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><strong>2019 Working Party Report</strong></h2>

<div class="paragraph"><span>
		<font color="#000000">How time flies!<span> </span>We will soon be coming to the end of another successful
			<span>season for the Museum and Gallery and it will be time to put the Museum </span>displays to
			bed<span>&nbsp; </span>--<span>&nbsp; </span>but only after special openings for Heritage and national Open
			Days in September!
		</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">We have been busy as usual with the ongoing maintenance of the Service Wing.<span>
			</span>Lots and lots of small but essential jobs that require attention - painting windows, fence post
			repairs, replacement of lighting in the display cabinets, wood preserver on the bell 'tabernacle',
			etc.<span> </span>New donation boxes have been made.</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">The big event of the year was the purchase of a 'summer house', at the entrance to the
			Service Wing, to greet our visitors.<span> </span>Many thanks to everybody that helped to put it up and
			paint it with preservative.<span> </span>It is a huge improvement and the stewards who man it appreciate the
			more sheltered seating area and protection from the vagaries of the English weather.</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">Many thanks again to the Working Party ladies, who do such an amazing job inside and
			outside to keep the Museum and the Courtyard looking smart and welcoming for our visitors.</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">Another thank you for all the help we receive to set up for the school visits and our
			monthly talks.<span> </span>The selection of cakes after the talks, with a cup of tea, is so
			enjoyable.<span> </span>On one school visit, an eight year old boy announced to me that it was Jeffrey
			Wyatt, who was the architect of the Mansion House.<span> </span>A future volunteer?</font>
	</span><br /><span></span><span>
		<font color="#000000">Again, please if you have any time to spare and would like to come along to the Stable
			Block on a Thursday morning for a coffee and chat about what we do there, we would love to see you.&nbsp;
