<h2 class="wsite-content-title"><strong>The Farmer Family of Nonsuch</strong></h2>
<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;">Samuel Farmer who purchased Nonsuch in 1799 claimed his lineage could be
	traced back through the<br /> paternal lines to the Fermor family of Easton Neston who had become the Earl's&nbsp;of
	Pomfret and through his mother's line to the Gamull family of Chester</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Fermor family trace their routes to Witney in Oxfordshire where they made their money in
	the&nbsp; wool trade. The dynasty was founded by a wool heiress Agnes Fermor and Henry&nbsp; Richards a welsh sheep
	farmer who had gained substantial land holding in&nbsp; Oxfordshire. Henry took his wife's name
	as she was higher in society's standing otherwise we would be referring to the Richards of Nonsuch.<br /><br />The
	family entered&nbsp; the court of Henry VIII when Richard Fermor's brother William attained the rank&nbsp; of privy
	councillor. Unfortunately Richard was a staunch catholic and the family&nbsp;retained its catholiscism and therefore
	they never really attained a place in&nbsp;court life after the final reinstallation of the Church of England
	under&nbsp;Elizabeth I. However they remained successful businessmen and eventually a second branch of the family
	was founded in Cork, Ireland by George Farmar's second son Robert. It is from this family that the Farmers of
	Nonsuch claim&nbsp;their descent.<br /><br />&nbsp;During the English&nbsp; Civil War the&nbsp;family was forced to
	return to England, returning after the&nbsp; restoration. Maybe the Nonsuch branch stayed in England or emigrated
	back to&nbsp; England in the 1680s as a result of changes to the trade law which crippled the&nbsp; cloth trade in
	Ireland. </div>

<div class="paragraph">The Farmers of&nbsp; Shoreditch founded their fortunes in scarlet dying which they ran from their
	premises in Hog Lane(now Worship Street) Shoreditch. Samuel Farmer's elder&nbsp; brother William made a career in
	the East India Company and together with his&nbsp; brother entered into many successful trading ventures. Through
	the connections&nbsp; to the Gamull <br /> family they gained their first family seat at Crabwall
	Hall,&nbsp;Cheshire.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The Farmers of&nbsp; Nonsuch spread themselves through marriage across Europe and to America
	and&nbsp; Canada. They rose through society establishing links to English and European&nbsp; aristocrats. Eventually
	through Alice's marriage to the Honourable Francis&nbsp; Lionel Lydstone Colborne, Equerry to Princess Henry of
	Batternberg they entered&nbsp; royal circles.&nbsp; Unfortunately Alice and Francis did not have any children
	and&nbsp; the estate at Nonsuch passed to Pamela Farmer a granddaughter of William Francis&nbsp; Gamul Farmer at
	Alice's death. It was subsequently sold to Surrey County Council&nbsp; in 1938.<br /><br /><BIG><STRONG>If you have
